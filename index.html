    <h2>The Role of + and -</h2>
    <div class="glowBox note" aria-label="Plus and minus explanation">
      <p>The plus (+) and minus (-) system is an informal but widely used way to provide more granularity within each letter rating.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A minus</strong> (e.g., B-) generally means a player or team is on the lower end of that skill spectrum, perhaps having just moved up from the previous level or lacking consistency in some areas.</li>
        <li><strong>A plus</strong> (e.g., B+) indicates a player or team is at the upper end of that level, demonstrating capabilities that border on the next skill bracket but are not yet consistent enough to fully be considered part of that higher tier.</li>
